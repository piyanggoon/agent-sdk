## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Cancelled outcomes in observability spans** - Root and turn-level observability instrumentation now records `cancelled` outcomes instead of omitting cancellation states.

### Changed

- **Non-blocking event channel** - The agent loop now uses non-blocking sends for events. If the event channel is full, it logs a warning and waits up to 30 seconds before timing out. If the channel is closed (consumer disconnected), the agent continues processing without blocking. This prevents slow consumers from stalling the LLM stream.

- **Improved stream resilience** - The streaming implementation now detects when the event channel is closed and continues processing the LLM response. This allows the agent to complete even if the consumer disconnects mid-stream.

- **Switched from `tracing` to `log` crate** - The SDK now uses the standard `log` crate instead of `tracing` for logging, making it compatible with any logging framework that implements `log` (e.g., `env_logger`, `simple_logger`, `fern`).

### Added

- **Optional OpenTelemetry observability** - Added an `otel` feature with observability helpers, payload/context propagation, `ObservabilityStore` hooks, and instrumentation for agent runs, turns, LLM calls, tool execution, subagent invocations, MCP client calls, and context compaction spans.

- **Stream progress logging** - Added periodic debug logging during stream processing to help diagnose issues:
  - `SSE chunk progress` every 10 chunks from the HTTP stream
  - `Stream progress` every 50 deltas processed
  - Warnings when the event channel is full or closed

- **Stream drop detection** - Added a drop guard that logs (to both `log::error!` and `stderr`) when the SSE stream is dropped before completion, helping diagnose task cancellation issues.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-27

### Added

- **`AsyncTool` trait** - New trait for long-running operations with progress streaming. Async tools have two phases: `execute()` starts the operation and returns immediately, `check_status()` streams progress updates until completion. Includes typed progress stages via `ProgressStage` trait.

- **`ToolExecutionStore` trait** - Write-ahead logging for tool execution tracking. Enables idempotency and crash recovery by persisting tool execution state before running tools. Includes `InMemoryExecutionStore` default implementation.

- **Extended thinking support** - `ThinkingConfig` for configuring Anthropic's extended thinking feature. Set `budget_tokens` to enable the model to think through complex problems before responding.

- **`ToolProgress` event** - New event type for async tool progress updates, containing stage, message, and optional data.

- **`ErasedToolStatus`** - Type-erased version of `ToolStatus` for use in the agent loop.

- **`ToolOutcome` enum** - Result type for async tools with `Success`, `Failed`, and `InProgress` variants.

### Fixed

- **Store timestamp handling** - Fixed timestamp serialization/deserialization issues in message stores.

### Changed

- **`ToolRegistry` now supports async tools** - New `register_async()` method and `get_async()`, `all_async()`, `is_async()` accessors for async tool management.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-23

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed `ToolTier::RequiresPin`** - The SDK now only has `Observe` and `Confirm` tiers. Applications that need PIN verification should implement this at the application layer using hooks.

- **Removed `ToolDecision::RequiresPin`** - Hooks no longer return this variant. Use `RequiresConfirmation` or `Block` instead.

- **Removed `PendingAction`** - Applications now manage the pending action lifecycle externally.

- **Removed `ToolRequiresPin` event** - This event is no longer emitted by the agent loop.

- **Tool trait now requires `type Name` associated type** - All `Tool` implementations must specify a tool name type:
  ```rust
  impl Tool<()> for MyTool {
      type Name = DynamicToolName;  // or your custom ToolName type
      fn name(&self) -> DynamicToolName { DynamicToolName::new("my_tool") }
      // ...
  }
  ```

- **`agent.run()` now returns a tuple** - The return type is `(mpsc::Receiver<AgentEvent>, impl Future<Output = AgentRunState>)` instead of just a receiver.

- **Input is now wrapped in `AgentInput`** - Use `AgentInput::Text(...)` instead of passing a plain string.

- **`AgentContinuation` is now a concrete type** - Previously used `Box<dyn Any>` for encapsulation. Now exposes all fields publicly. The continuation is boxed in enum variants for efficiency (`Box<AgentContinuation>`).

- **New `PendingToolCallInfo` struct** - Public type representing pending tool calls, used within `AgentContinuation`.

### Added

- **Typed tool names** - Tool names are now strongly typed via the `ToolName` trait and associated type:
  - `PrimitiveToolName` enum for SDK's built-in tools
  - `DynamicToolName` for runtime/MCP tools
  - `tool_name_to_string()` and `tool_name_from_str()` helpers

- **`display_name()` method on Tool trait** - Tools can now provide a human-readable display name for UIs.

- **Yield/Resume pattern** - Agent can yield execution when a tool requires confirmation via `AgentRunState::AwaitingConfirmation`, then resume with `AgentInput::Resume`.

- **Single-turn execution** - New `run_turn()` method for external orchestration (e.g., message queues). Returns `TurnOutcome` indicating whether more turns are needed.

- **`AgentRunState` enum** - New return type indicating agent completion status: `Done`, `Error`, or `AwaitingConfirmation`.

- **`AgentContinuation`** - Concrete state for resuming agent execution after yielding. Contains fields like `thread_id`, `turn`, `turn_usage`, `pending_tool_calls`, etc.

- **Streaming support** - LLM providers now support streaming responses via `stream_chat_completion`.

### Fixed

- **Token usage tracking in resume cases** - Previously, token usage was zeroed when resuming after tool confirmation. Now properly tracks usage from the LLM call that generated the tool calls.

### Changed

- **Tool trait no longer requires `#[async_trait]`** - Rust 1.75+ native async traits are used instead.

- **Refactored agent loop** - Internal refactoring into smaller helper functions for better maintainability.
